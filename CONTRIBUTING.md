Contributing Guidelines ‚Äì Patient Profile Service

Thank you for contributing! This backend service powers the central patient/member identity layer of our platform. It is designed to be agent-maintainable, schema-driven, and highly interoperable with external systems.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ General Principles
	‚Ä¢	Follow clear and modular patterns
	‚Ä¢	Use docstrings and type hints for every function, class, and Pydantic model
	‚Ä¢	Prioritize declarative and testable code
	‚Ä¢	Structure code for AI agents and human devs to read and extend easily

‚∏ª

üß± Architecture Notes for Contributors and AI Assistants

1. Pydantic Models
	‚Ä¢	All fields must be explicitly typed
	‚Ä¢	Use nested models where needed (e.g. EmergencyContact)
	‚Ä¢	Attach descriptive docstrings ‚Äî these are used by AI agents to generate or refactor code

2. Extensions Model
	‚Ä¢	New fields from external systems are not hardcoded
	‚Ä¢	They are defined in YAML files (e.g. hint_fields.yaml) and loaded dynamically into the extensions object
	‚Ä¢	Do not rename or flatten extensions ‚Äî each vendor (e.g. Hint, Elation) has its own namespace

3. Field Ownership & Trust
	‚Ä¢	Every synced field must include metadata about the source system (e.g. "phone": "hint", "dob": "elation")
	‚Ä¢	Logic that updates fields must respect ownership rules
	‚Ä¢	If a conflicting value is detected, do not overwrite it silently ‚Äî prefer trust score resolution or human-in-the-loop validation

4. Agent-Aware Coding
	‚Ä¢	Use consistent naming: patient, profile, extensions, source_system
	‚Ä¢	Document assumptions inside comments where logic might seem unclear to a future agent
	‚Ä¢	Avoid inline magic values or logic ‚Äî use named constants and helper functions

5. Routing and API
	‚Ä¢	Use FastAPI path operation decorators with proper request/response models
	‚Ä¢	Ensure endpoints are self-documenting via docstrings
	‚Ä¢	Avoid untyped dict returns ‚Äî always use BaseModel

‚∏ª

üö® What Not to Do
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Do not hardcode vendor-specific fields in the patient model
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Do not flatten the extensions object
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Do not delete or override trust_score without a validated algorithm
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Do not remove YAML field support logic from the loader

‚úÖ Pull Request Checklist
	‚Ä¢	Code uses type hints and Pydantic models
	‚Ä¢	No core schema fields were modified without approval
	‚Ä¢	extensions structure preserved and test-covered
	‚Ä¢	Unit or snapshot tests added for any new logic
	‚Ä¢	Changes described in PR summary with links to issue/task

Thank you! This system is built for long-term reliability and future AI co-development ‚Äî your clear, modular contributions make it stronger.
